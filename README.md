Champaign Coffee Matcher is a web application that recommends the best coffee for University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) students. The app scrapes data from coffee shop menus in Champaign and uses a matching algorithm to give personalized recommendations based on the user's preferences. Users can rate the coffee and provide feedback to help improve the recommendations.
